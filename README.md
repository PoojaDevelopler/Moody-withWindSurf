## ü§ñ AI Generation Details

This project was generated using **WindSurf**, an AI-powered development tool for Swift.  
The app concept and structure were created from a single natural language prompt crafted with **ChatGPT**.

**Prompt used to generate this project:**

> ‚ÄúBuild a single-screen SwiftUI app called *Mood Weather*.  
> Goal: A minimal yet elegant one-screen app that changes its background color and animation based on the selected mood.  
> Requirements:  
> 1. Use only SwiftUI.  
> 2. The app should have a smooth UI/UX and a calming color palette.  
> 3. The user selects their current mood from 4 options: ‚òÄÔ∏è Happy, üåßÔ∏è Sad, üå©Ô∏è Angry, üåà Calm.  
> 4. Each mood should:  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Change the background gradient color.  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Show an animated SF Symbol that fits the vibe.  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Animate transitions smoothly.  
> 5. Include a title ‚ÄúMood Weather‚Äù at the top with a subtle fade-in effect.  
> 6. Center the mood icon and name with animation when mood changes.  
> 7. Use rounded buttons and clean font styling.  
> 8. No API or backend logic.  
> 9. Include SwiftUI Canvas previews.  
> 10. Add soft pulsing motion to the mood icon when it changes.‚Äù
