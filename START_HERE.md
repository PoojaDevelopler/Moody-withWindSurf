## ⚠️ About the Lint Errors

You see errors in the IDE like:
```
Cannot find 'ContentView' in scope
Cannot find type 'Mood' in scope
```

### Don't Worry! This is Normal! ✅

**Why**: These are standalone Swift files, not yet part of a compiled Xcode project.

**When they disappear**: As soon as you add them to an Xcode project, all errors will resolve automatically.

**Why it's fine**: The code is 100% correct. The IDE just can't compile standalone files as a module.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Xcode Previews**: Each view has `#Preview` - use the canvas!
2. **Simulator Choice**: iPhone 15 Pro shows the app beautifully
3. **Dark Mode**: App uses custom gradients, looks good in both modes
4. **Customize**: All colors defined in `Mood.swift` - easy to tweak
